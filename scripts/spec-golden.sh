#!/usr/bin/env bash
# scripts/spec-golden.sh — Check or update the contract spec golden files
#
# Reads the built (optimized) WASM for each contract and extracts the contract
# spec — the public function names, signatures, types and event discriminants —
# using `stellar contract info interface --wasm <file> --output json`.
#
# The output must match the committed `contracts/<crate>/spec.golden.json`.
# Unexpected diffs fail the check so that renaming or removing an entrypoint
# (which would silently break every generated binding) is caught in review.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/spec-golden.sh            # fail on unreviewed diffs
#   bash scripts/spec-golden.sh --update   # overwrite committed golden files
#
# Both the WASM and the optimized artifact must be present:
#   cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --locked -p alert-registry -p watcher-registry
#   for crate in alert-registry watcher-registry; do
#     stellar contract optimize --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/${crate//-/_}.wasm
#   done
